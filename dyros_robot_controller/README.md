- **Mobile Robots**
  - Supports differential drive, mecanum, and caster wheel configurations  
  - Provides kinematics-based Forward/Inverse Kinematics  

- **Manipulators**
  - Joint-space position, velocity, and torque control  
  - Task-space control using Jacobian-based CLIK (Closed-loop Inverse Kinematics)  
  - Dynamic control using OSF (Operational Space Formulation)  
  - QP-based controllers that handle constraints (joint limits, velocity, collision avoidance, etc.)  

- **Mobile Manipulators**
  - Whole-body torque-based controller  

- **Simulation and Real-World Integration**
  - Validated in simulation with:  
    - Mobile robots: ClearPath Husky, Summit XL, 4-wheel powered caster vehicle  
    - Manipulators: Franka FR3, UR5  
    - Mobile manipulators: Husky-FR3, XLS-FR3  
  - Real robot integration in progress
